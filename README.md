# gitpod-workspace

Simple installation for a Gitpod workspace.

After launching, make sure to run:

~~~
./setup.sh
~~~

# Motivation

Gitpod is useful for working on one repository, but for work spanning multiple repositories, not so much.

This setup gives you the flexibility of working on multiple repositories at once.
